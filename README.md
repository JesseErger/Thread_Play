# Thread_Play
My first attempts at threading
Attempting to calculate the closest point pairs in multi-dimensional space. Dataset is a list of points, using the query file I will output (to a file) the closest point in the dataset (by line number) using multiple threads.

Usage ->  ./<executable> datafile queryfile outputfile number_threads
